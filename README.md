# Trip service on Spring Boot

Legacy code kata inspired by the famous Trip Service Kata.

This kata implements a TripService as a Spring Boot Controller connecting to a real PostgreSQL database.

This code was useful for me in a training. The idea is to show legacy code testing problems when the legacy code is coupled to a real database.

There is only an end-to-end test without any unit test commited.
